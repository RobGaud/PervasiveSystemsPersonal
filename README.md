This code represents a small demo taken from the Personal Project realized for Pervasive Systems class, lectured by prof. Ioannis Chatzigiannakis.<br/>
It is a simple client-server room-chat application in Python, where users send their messages to the server that forwards them to all connected users.<br/>
It is also a simple example of usage of the InfluxDB database, since messages are stored by the server into it. <br/>
